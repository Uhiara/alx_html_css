🎧 Headphone Website: Responsive Design Implementation
This project implements a fully responsive, pixel-perfect frontend design for a headphone marketing website, based on a provided Figma file. This implementation was completed as part of the ALX Africa curriculum.

✨ Features and Achievements
Pixel-Perfect Design: Accurately replicates the layout, spacing, typography, and color scheme of the Figma design.

Fully Responsive: Implements a mobile-first approach, with a primary breakpoint at 480px to switch between desktop/tablet and mobile layouts.

Interactive Header: Features a mobile-only Hamburger Menu implemented using pure JavaScript to toggle the navigation links.

Pure CSS Drawing: The pentagon shapes in the "Our results" section are drawn entirely using CSS clip-path, avoiding the use of an image file.

CSS Animations: Includes smooth hover animations (scaling and rotation) on the service cards and result pentagons using CSS Transitions.
